 I have done this project mostly out of courisity. I was working with the code of LSTM cell from the Udacity deep learning course and spend a lot 
 of time on understanding the LSTM and GRU cell using a youtube video.
 
 To further understand it I used the architecture from the video to convert the LSTM cell into a GRU cell. The screenshots from the Youtube video
 are in the repository.
 
 1. I kept every thing else same and just changed the cell.
 2. Initally, GRU cell was not working as good as the LSTM cell
 3. Upon decreasing the step size, GRU cell started working Equally good.
 4. GRU cell was somewhat faster the the LSTM cell.
 
 
 Go throuhg the code and compare only the parts where I have defined the GRU and the LSTM functions  and compare the code to the screen 
 shots of the architecture to understand it.
